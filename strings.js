// Anything written inside the double quotes or a single quote is known as the string.

let a="hello"

console.log(a);


//You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

let a="hello world we have 'nice' day";
let b='hello world we have "nice" day';
console.log(a,b);

//To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;
console.log(lenghth);
